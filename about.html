<h2>About Us</h2>

<p>The Fresno Veterans Day Parade honors our veterans from all branches. The parade is held in downtown Fresno. It 
has grown by leaps and bounds over its nine decades of existence, so much so in fact, 
that in 2007, the Executive Board of the Parade presented the idea of becoming incorporated and applying for 
501(c)3 status.  The response was unanimous and the parade became a not-for-profit corporation in California.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<h3>Veterans Day</h3>
<p>Wikipedia &ndash; U.S. President Woodrow Wilson first proclaimed Armistice Day for November 11, 1919. In proclaiming the holiday, he said
"To us in America, the reflections of Armistice Day will be filled with solemn pride in the heroism of 
those who died in the country's service and with gratitude for the victory, both because of the thing from 
which it has freed us and because of the opportunity it has given America to show her sympathy with peace 
and justice in the councils of the nations."[2]</p>
<p>The United States Congress passed a concurrent resolution seven years later on June 4, 1926, 
requesting that President Calvin Coolidge issue another proclamation to observe November 11 with 
appropriate ceremonies.[2] A Congressional Act (52 Stat. 351; 5 U.S. Code, Sec. 87a) approved May 13, 
1938, made the 11th of November in each year a legal holiday: "a day to be dedicated to the cause of 
world peace and to be thereafter celebrated and known as 'Armistice Day'."</p>
<p>In 1945, WWII veteran Raymond Weeks from Birmingham, 
Alabama had the idea to expand Armistice Day to celebrate all 
veterans, not just those who died in World War I. Weeks led 
a delegation to Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, who supported the 
idea of National Veterans Day. Weeks led the first national 
celebration in 1947 in Alabama and annually until his death 
in 1985. President Reagan honored Weeks at The White House 
with the Presidential Citizenship Medal in 1982 as the driving 
force for the national holiday. Elizabeth Dole, who prepared 
the briefing for President Reagan, determined Weeks as the 
"Father of Veterans Day."</p>
<p>U.S. Representative Ed Rees from Emporia, Kansas,
 presented a bill establishing the holiday through Congress.
  President Dwight Eisenhower, also from Kansas, 
  signed the bill into law on May 26, 1954.[3]</p>
<p>Congress amended this act on June 1, 1954, replacing 
"Armistice" with "Veterans," and it has been known as 
Veterans Day since.[4][5]</p>
<p>The National Veterans Award, created in 1954, also 
started in Birmingham, Alabama. Congressman Rees of Kansas 
was honored in Alabama as the first recipient of the award 
for his support offering legislation to make Veterans Day 
a federal holiday, which marked nine years of effort by 
Raymond Weeks. Weeks conceived the idea in 1945, petitioned 
Gen. Eisenhower in 1946, led the first Veterans Day 
celebration in 1947 (keeping the official name Armistice 
Day until Veterans Day was legal in 1954).</p>
<p>Although originally scheduled for celebration on November 
11 of every year, starting in 1971 in accordance with the 
Uniform Monday Holiday Act, Veterans Day was moved to the 
fourth Monday of October. In 1978, it was moved back to its 
original celebration on November 11.</p>
